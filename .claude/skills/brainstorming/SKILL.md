# Brainstorming Session

Launch the BMAD Brainstorming workflow for structured creative ideation.

Read and follow the workflow instructions at:
`{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming/workflow.md`

If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided, pass it as the initial topic or context file for the session.

This workflow facilitates interactive brainstorming sessions targeting 100+ ideas through structured creative thinking techniques, combating semantic clustering bias, and pushing into novel territory.
