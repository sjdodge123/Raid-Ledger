# Session Init

Initialize a development session by pulling current state from Linear (source of truth) and regenerating lightweight local cache files.

**Principle:** Linear is the single source of truth. Local files are regenerated caches:
- `planning-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — project status + active sprint snapshot (Linear cache)
- `task.md` — session working doc with checkboxes

## Step 1 — Parallel Data Gathering

Fetch ALL of the following in a single parallel tool-call block:

1. **Linear issues:** `mcp__linear__list_issues` with `project: "Raid Ledger"`, `limit: 250`
2. **Current cycle:** `mcp__linear__list_cycles` with `teamId: "0728c19f-5268-4e16-aa45-c944349ce386"`, `type: "current"`
3. **Story file count:** Glob `implementation-artifacts/stories/ROK-*.md`
4. **Git state:** Run `git status --porcelain` and `git log --oneline -5` (two Bash calls)
5. **Focus story (conditional):** If `$ARGUMENTS` matches the pattern `ROK-` followed by digits, also read `implementation-artifacts/stories/$ARGUMENTS.md`

**Cycle handling:** If the cycle response is empty or has no active cycle, set `currentCycle = null`. All downstream steps use the fallback (no-sprint) path. If a cycle exists, use it to identify sprint-scoped stories (issues assigned to that cycle).

Do NOT read AGENTS.md — it is redundant with CLAUDE.md which is auto-loaded.

## Step 2 — Regenerate Local Caches

### 2a. sprint-status.yaml (Linear → local)

From the Linear issues response, **overwrite** `planning-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`:

```yaml
# generated: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
# source: Linear (Raid Ledger project) — do not hand-edit
# regenerate: /init pulls from Linear
project: Raid Ledger
tracking_system: linear

current_sprint:
  name: "<cycle name>"
  number: <N>
  starts: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
  ends: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
  progress: "<done>/<total>"
  stories:
    - ROK-XXX    # <title> (<status>)

development_status:
  # === Done ===
  ROK-XXX: done           # <issue title>

  # === In Progress ===
  ROK-XXX: in-progress    # <issue title>

  # === Ready for Dev ===
  ROK-XXX: ready-for-dev  # <issue title>

  # === Review ===
  ROK-XXX: review         # <issue title>

  # === Backlog ===
  ROK-XXX: backlog        # <issue title>

  # === Deprecated ===
  ROK-XXX: deprecated     # <issue title>
```

**`current_sprint` block:** Only emitted when a cycle is active. Place above `development_status`. If no cycle exists, omit the entire block (backward compatible). Sprint stories are listed with their ROK identifier, title, and current status. `progress` counts done stories vs total stories in the cycle.

**Status mapping (Linear → local):**

| Linear Status | Local Status |
|---|---|
| Done | `done` |
| In Progress | `in-progress` |
| Todo | `ready-for-dev` |
| In Review | `review` |
| Backlog | `backlog` |
| Canceled | `deprecated` |
| Duplicate | *(skip — do not include)* |

Sort entries by ROK number (ascending) within each status group. Omit empty groups.

### 2b. task.md (Session working doc)

**Overwrite** `task.md` with the session's working document.

**With active cycle (sprint-first layout):**

```markdown
# Session: <YYYY-MM-DD>
<!-- Generated by /init from Linear -->
<!-- [x] = done, [/] = in progress, [ ] = not started -->

## Sprint: <cycle name> (<start YYYY-MM-DD> → <end YYYY-MM-DD>)
<!-- Progress: X/Y stories done -->
### In Progress
- [/] ROK-XXX: <title>
### Ready for Dev
- [ ] ROK-XXX: <title>  (<priority>)

## Other Work
### In Progress
- [/] ROK-XXX: <title>
### Ready for Dev (top 10)
- [ ] ROK-XXX: <title>  (<priority>)

## Session Notes
<!-- Add context, blockers, decisions as you work -->
```

Sprint stories (those assigned to the active cycle) appear under the Sprint heading. All other in-progress and ready-for-dev stories appear under "Other Work". Omit empty sub-sections.

**No active cycle (flat fallback — identical to previous format):**

```markdown
# Session: <YYYY-MM-DD>
<!-- Generated by /init from Linear -->
<!-- [x] = done, [/] = in progress, [ ] = not started -->

## In Progress
- [/] ROK-XXX: <title>

## Ready for Dev
- [ ] ROK-XXX: <title>  (<priority>)

## Session Notes
<!-- Add context, blockers, decisions as you work -->
```

Populate from Linear issues:
- **In Progress:** All issues with status "In Progress", sorted by ROK number
- **Ready for Dev:** All issues with status "Todo", sorted by priority (Urgent > High > Normal > Low > None), then by ROK number. Limit to top 15 (or top 10 for "Other Work" when a sprint is active).
- Include priority label in parentheses: `(P0)` for Urgent, `(P1)` for High, `(P2)` for Normal, `(P3)` for Low. Omit if None.

## Step 3 — Compute Derived Values

### Current Sprint
If a cycle was returned in Step 1: extract name, start date, end date, and compute days remaining. If no cycle: "No active sprint".

### Next Story Number
From the Glob results of `implementation-artifacts/stories/ROK-*.md`, extract all numeric suffixes, find the highest, and add 1.

### Top 3 Priorities
When a sprint is active: draw from sprint stories first (in-progress, then ready-for-dev by priority). When no sprint: draw from the Ready for Dev section of task.md (first 3 entries, already sorted by priority).

## Step 4 — Present Dashboard & Checkpoint

Output a single compact dashboard.

**With active sprint:**
```
Session Init | <YYYY-MM-DD>
Sprint: <name> | <start> → <end> | <done>/<total> done

Stories: <count> files | Next: ROK-<N>
Git: <branch> | <clean/dirty — e.g. "3 modified, 1 untracked">
Recent: <latest commit one-liner>
Linear: <total issues> synced → sprint-status.yaml + task.md regenerated
Sprint:  X/Y stories | Z days left

Sprint Priorities:
  1. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>
  2. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>
  3. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>

Summary: <done> done | <in-progress> active | <ready> ready | <backlog> backlog
```

**No active sprint:**
```
Session Init | <YYYY-MM-DD>
No active sprint

Stories: <count> files | Next: ROK-<N>
Git: <branch> | <clean/dirty — e.g. "3 modified, 1 untracked">
Recent: <latest commit one-liner>
Linear: <total issues> synced → sprint-status.yaml + task.md regenerated

Top Priorities:
  1. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>
  2. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>
  3. ROK-XXX  <priority>  <title>

Summary: <done> done | <in-progress> active | <ready> ready | <backlog> backlog
```

### Checkpoint Behavior

Route based on `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **No arguments:** After the dashboard, present: "Path? **active-sprint** or **planning**" — then wait for the user to choose.
- **`sprint`:** After the dashboard, output: "Routing to active sprint. Top priority: ROK-XXX — <title>." — then stop.
- **`planning`:** After the dashboard, output: "Routing to planning mode." — then stop.
- **`ROK-XXX`** (a specific story ID): After the dashboard, append a **Focus Story** section:
  ```
  --- Focus: ROK-XXX ---
  Status: <status from Linear>
  <First 3 lines of the story file's "## Story" section>
  ACs: <count of acceptance criteria checkboxes>
  Deps: <dependency list or "none">
  ```
  Then stop.
