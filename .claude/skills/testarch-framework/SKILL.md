# Test Architecture Framework Setup

Launch the BMAD Test Architecture Framework workflow.

Read and follow the workflow instructions at:
`{project-root}/_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/framework/workflow.yaml`

Also read the instructions file at:
`{project-root}/_bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/framework/instructions.md`

This workflow auto-detects or allows user selection of a test framework (Playwright/Cypress), then sets up directory structure, fixtures, helpers, and configuration files.
