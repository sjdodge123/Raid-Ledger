# Step 4: Confirm Dispatch

**If the operator already approved a batch plan during Step 3 discussion** (e.g., "let's go with A", "sounds good", "approved"), skip this step entirely — that approval IS the dispatch confirmation. Do NOT re-ask with "dispatch all / select / skip". Proceed directly to Step 5.

**Only if the operator has NOT yet approved,** ask:
- **Dispatch all** — run all batches in order (stories within each batch run in parallel)
- **Select** — let user pick which stories/batches to dispatch
- **Skip** — don't dispatch, just show the summary
