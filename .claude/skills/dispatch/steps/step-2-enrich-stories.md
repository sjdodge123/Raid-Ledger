# Step 2: Enrich Stories

## For Rework stories (Changes Requested):

Fetch comments in parallel for each:
```
mcp__linear__list_comments(issueId: <issue.id>)
```

Identify **review feedback** — comments posted AFTER the most recent agent summary comment (agent summaries contain "## Implementation Summary" or "## Review Feedback Addressed" or "Commit:" patterns).

If there are screenshots in feedback comments (markdown image links), describe what the reviewer is pointing out based on surrounding text.

## For New Work stories (Todo):

The Linear issue description IS the spec. Extract:
- Title and priority
- Acceptance criteria count
- Key files mentioned in technical approach (if any)
- Dependencies on other stories (if mentioned)
